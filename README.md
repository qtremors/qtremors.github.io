# 🌐 Project Overview

This repository features two distinct versions of a personal portfolio website, each with its own unique aesthetic and technical approach:

- 🌇 **[`index.html`](https://qtremors.github.io/tremors)** – A modern, Material Design-inspired UI with smooth animations, a dark mode toggle, and interactive elements.  
- 👨‍💻 **[`indextui.html`](https://qtremors.github.io/tremors/indextui.html)** – A terminal-inspired TUI (Text User Interface) with a retro feel, featuring multiple themes, fonts, and a CSS-only splash screen.  

Both versions are fully responsive, minimalist, and built with clean, semantic HTML and CSS. The TUI version is completely JavaScript-free, while the modern version uses vanilla JS to enhance user experience.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌇 Modern UI (`index.html`)

- 🔁 **Fully Responsive** – Adapts beautifully to phones, tablets, and desktops.  
- 🌗 **Dark Mode Toggle** – Switch between light and dark themes that persist across sessions.  
- 🙈 **Auto-Hiding UI** – The top app bar and bottom navigation bar gracefully hide on scroll-down and reappear on scroll-up for an immersive experience.  
- 📊 **Interactive Skill Badges** – Skill proficiency is visualized with a subtle animated bar on hover.  
- 🚀 **Modern Stack** – Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clean code and performance.  

### 👨‍💻 Terminal UI (`indextui.html`)

- 🎨 **Multi-Theme & Font Support** – Switch between Dracula and Catppuccin themes, and Fira Code and Roboto Mono fonts using TUI-style dropdown menus.  
- 🎬 **Animated Splash Screen** – A retro ASCII art logo animates on page load for a classic terminal boot-up feel.  
- 📁 **TUI Layout** – A file-path-inspired navigation system (`./about`, `./skills`, etc.) enhances the terminal aesthetic.  
- 💨 **Zero JavaScript** – All features, including the splash screen, theme switcher, and font selector, are implemented purely with HTML and CSS for a lightning-fast, lightweight experience.
