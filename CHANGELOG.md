## [v1.5.0] - 23-11-2025

### 🚀 **Major Architectural Changes**

- **Modular CSS Architecture:** refactored monolithic stylesheets into a maintainable, `@import` based system.
    
    - **Modern UI:** Split `index.css` into `index-variables.css`, `index-animations.css`, `index-base.css`, `index-sections.css`, and `index-navigation.css`.
        
    - **TUI:** Split `tui.css` into `tui-themes.css`, `tui-animations.css`, and `tui-base.css`.
        
- **Data Decoupling:** Removed hardcoded project HTML cards from `index.html`. Projects are now fetched dynamically from `projects.json` via JavaScript.
    
- **File Renaming:** Renamed `indextui.html` to `tui.html` for cleaner URL routing.

### 🌇 **Modern UI (`index.html`)**

#### **Features & Logic**

- **Dynamic Project Loading:** Implemented `fetch()` logic to load projects from `projects.json`.
    
    - Added logic to initially show only the top 5 projects.
        
    - Added a "Load More/Show Less" toggle button to handle the remaining projects.
        
- **Theme Engine:**
    
    - Added support for **Material Design 3 (MD3)** via a dedicated `md3.css` override system.
        
    - Implemented a "Shape Engine" enforcing 16px/28px "squircles" on buttons and cards when MD3 is active.
        
    - Added a JavaScript-based theme toggle (Light/Dark) with `localStorage` persistence.
        
- **Easter Eggs:**
    
    - Added a developer console message inviting users to check the source code.
        
    - Implemented a "Konami code" style listener: Typing `python` or `tremors` triggers a specific alert and ASCII art in the console.
        

#### **Styling (CSS)**

- **Gradients:** Added a "Neon" conic-gradient (Pink/Purple/Cyan) to the logo, dropdowns, and profile picture borders.
    
- **Animations:** Added `jigglet` (title hover), `pulse`, and `infinite-rotate` animations for improved micro-interactions.
    
- **Navigation:** Implemented a scroll-aware navigation bar that hides on scroll down and reveals on scroll up using a debounce function.

### 👾 **Terminal UI (`tui.html`)**

#### **Theming**

- **New Theme:** Added **Tokyo Night** (`#1a1b26`) to the existing Dracula and Catppuccin theme options.
    
- **Responsive Typography:** Adjusted font sizes for mobile devices (`14px` root, `6px` ASCII art) to prevent layout breakage on small screens.
    

#### **Interactivity (CSS-Only)**

- **Project filtering:** Implemented a "Show More" feature for portfolio items using the `:target` CSS selector.
    
    - Projects #6 and onwards are hidden by default.
        
    - Clicking `ls -a .hidden` targets `#hidden-projects`, changing its display property to `flex` without using JavaScript.

### 🚧 **System Pages**

- **404 Pages:**
    
    - Created `index-404.html`: A graphical "Working on it" page with a GIF toggle (switching between a cat and coding animation).

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes & Refinements**
